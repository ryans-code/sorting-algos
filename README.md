# sorting-practice
Practicing some sorting algorithms in C++ to prepare for trying to make a sorting visualizer in React in the near future (maybe).

Four sorting algorithms are implemented currently: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. I am happy with four algorithms for now.

This program will generate a random array, print the random array as a bar graph to the console as well as display the values held at each index of the array. 
A sorting function is then called and the print function is called again, to visually see that the array has been sorted.
This process occurs for each of the sorting functions. If attempting to run this program, feel free to comment out any display functions.

In the future, may try to implement the number of steps calculated in each sorting algorithm to compare speed and efficiency between them.
